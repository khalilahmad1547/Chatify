# Project Description: Chat Application for Customer Support
This project is a full-featured chat application that can be integrated with any website to provide customer support. It consists of three main components: a backend API, an admin panel for customer support teams, and a web component for integration into websites.

## Backend API
The backend API is built using the Ruby on Rails framework and uses a Postgresql and Redis database for data storage. The API provides all the necessary functionality for the chat application, including user authentication, chat management, and real-time messaging using WebSockets. The API is designed to be scalable, secure, and highly available.

## Admin Panel
The admin panel is built using React.js with Redux Toolkit in TypeScript. It provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for customer support teams to manage chats and respond to customer inquiries. The admin panel allows customer support teams to see all the users who have requested help in chat and to reply to each one of them. The panel also provides real-time updates on chat statuses, allowing teams to respond quickly to customer inquiries.

## Web Component
The web component is built using LitElement in TypeScript and is designed to be easily integrated into any website. The component provides a seamless and responsive user interface for customers to chat with support teams directly from the website. The web component is highly customizable, allowing website owners to match the look and feel of the chat application to their website's design.

## How to Use
To use the chat application, website owners can sign up for an account and provide basic details about their website. Once signed up, website owners can add multiple websites to their account and manage them with separate customer support teams. The chat application can be easily integrated into websites by adding a few lines of code.

Overall, this project provides a powerful and flexible chat application for customer support teams to manage customer inquiries in a seamless and efficient manner. With its scalable backend API, intuitive admin panel, and customizable web component, the chat application can be easily integrated into any website to provide an exceptional customer support experience.
